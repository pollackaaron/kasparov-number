Checkmate Kasparov
==================
This is a project to help chess players calculate how many wins away they are from Kasparov. We scraped the USCF website to create a graph of connections between a given USCF registered player and Garry Kasparov.

This was the final project that I worked on in the CodeFellows bootcamp.
